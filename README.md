Python program to return a list of critically acclaimed movies to watch 

This program pull and aggregates data from MetaCritic, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes and passes it through specific review score thresholds
that I have set based on personal preferences and returns a list of the latest critically acclaimed movies I should watch in any given point in time.

I tend to be pretty selective about the movies I watch in a way that is easy to quantify. Typically, I will only watch movies that score above 80 
out of a 100 on MetaCritic, above 70% on audience score and 90% on critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and above 7 on IMDb. The program I wrote 
incorporates all these different rules and generates the appropriate output. 

It also returns the name of the respective director for each film as that is also a factor I often consider.
